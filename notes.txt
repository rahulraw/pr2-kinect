PR2 Force torque tools:
   For bringing up and configuring force-torque sensors on the PR2
   Contains calibration data and tools for manipulating /etc/ros that don't
      belong in ROS

/usr/share/pr2-ft/
   - calibration data for all PR2 force-torque sensors
   - build should check these out from svn rather than maintaining duplicate
      copies of them here

/usr/bin/pr2-ft-config
   - Tool to manage the URDF updates and robot.launch updates for force-torque
      sensors
   - invocations:
      pr2-ft-config --left <ID>
         add/configure left F/T sensor with given ID
         - may also be specified as -l
         - should check and update the URDF
         - should check and update robot.launch
         - should throw an error if there is no cal data for the specified
            sensor
      pr2-ft-config --right <ID>
         add/configure right F/T sensor with given ID
         - may also be specified as -r
         - same requirements and actions as left
      pr2-ft-config --distro <distro> ...
         Manage files in /etc/ros/<distro> instead of /etc/ros
         - may also be -d
      pr2-ft-config --urdf [URDF]
         Only configure the URDF. 
         If a path is given, configure that particular URDF
         - may also be -u
      pr2-ft-config --launch
         Only configure the launch file
   - --left and --right may be specified together
